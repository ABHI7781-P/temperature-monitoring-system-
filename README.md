#The Temperature Monitoring System project is a simple yet powerful demonstration of how web-based technologies can simulate embedded systems like a temperature monitoring interface with an LCD display. This project is particularly helpful for beginners who want to understand the basics of user interfaces and real-time data representation. It combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive interface that displays temperature values, simulating how an actual embedded LCD would function in a physical monitoring device.

*Objective of the Project*
The main goal of this project is to simulate a temperature monitoring system where a user can read temperature values by clicking a button. When the “Read Temperature” button is pressed, a new temperature value is generated and displayed on a virtual LCD screen. The display mimics the visual style of a physical LCD, using CSS for effects like backlighting and glowing text.
